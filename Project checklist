PART 3: COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY CHECKLIST (100%)
CORE FEATURES

1. Authentication (Users)

 Email signup
 Email login
 Password hashing (bcrypt)
 Logout
 Forgot password
 Email verification
 Session management
 Protected API routes

Why: Security. Users need secure accounts to store campaigns & API keys.

2. Campaign Management

 Create new campaign
 Edit campaign name
 Edit subject line template
 Edit context/instructions for AI
 Delete campaign
 Campaign status (draft → scheduled → active → completed)
 View all campaigns
 Campaign timestamps (created, updated, started, ended)

Why: Users need to manage multiple campaigns. Different campaigns = different email sequences to different audiences.

3. Contact Management (CSV Upload)

 Upload CSV file
 Parse CSV (first_name, last_name, email, company, position)
 Validate email format
 Detect duplicates within campaign
 Detect bounced emails from previous campaigns (don't email them again)
 Upload progress indicator
 Error reporting (which rows failed, why)
 Delete contacts from campaign
 View contact list with details
 Search/filter contacts

Why: Sales teams have 100-1000 contacts. Bulk upload > manual entry. Validation prevents sending to bad emails (damages sender reputation).

4. AI Email Generation (GPT-4)

 Generate 5 email variations per contact
 Personalization (use first_name, company, position in email)
 Subject line generation
 Email body generation
 Professional tone (customizable)
 Avoid generic/spammy language
 Test different prompt templates
 Cache generated emails (don't regenerate)
 Show variations to user before sending
 Allow user to edit variations manually

Why: Manual cold emails = 20 hours/week. AI-generated = 30 minutes. Better personalization = higher open rates (5% → 20%).

5. Email Sending (SendGrid)

 Send emails via SendGrid API
 Use verified sender email
 Subject line from variation
 Email body from variation
 Track SendGrid message ID
 Handle bounces (invalid email, etc)
 Handle rate limits
 Batch sending (send 100 at a time, not 1 by 1)
 Scheduling (send at optimal time)
 Stop sending if too many bounces

Why: SendGrid is the email sending infrastructure. Without it, emails go to spam (Gmail, Outlook flag it). Scheduling = higher open rates (send when target reads email).

6. Email Tracking (Webhooks)

 Receive webhook from SendGrid (open event)
 Receive webhook from SendGrid (click event)
 Receive webhook from SendGrid (reply event)
 Receive webhook from SendGrid (bounce event)
 Update email_logs table with events
 Track timestamp for each event
 Mark contact as "replied" (stop following up)
 Mark contact as "bounced" (remove from future campaigns)

Why: You need to know who opened, clicked, replied. This drives follow-ups and conversions. Tracking tells you campaign effectiveness.

7. Follow-up Sequences

 Schedule follow-up emails (delay 3 days, 7 days, 14 days)
 Only send follow-ups to non-responders
 Customizable follow-up templates
 Stop follow-ups if contact replied
 Stop follow-ups if contact bounced
 Multiple follow-up sequences (2-5 follow-ups per person)
 Cron job to send scheduled follow-ups
 View follow-up status in dashboard

Why: First email = 5% reply rate. Follow-up 1 = 25% of those open. Follow-up 2 = 40% of those. Without follow-ups, you leave 70% of replies on the table.

8. Campaign Analytics Dashboard

 Total emails sent
 Total emails opened
 Total emails clicked
 Total replies received
 Total bounces
 Open rate % (opened / sent)
 Click rate % (clicked / sent)
 Reply rate % (replied / sent)
 Bounce rate % (bounced / sent)
 Real-time updates (live dashboard)
 Charts showing trends over time
 Export data as CSV
 Compare multiple campaigns

Why: Users need to see ROI. "50 emails sent, 10 opened, 2 clicked, 1 replied" = proof it works. Charts make the story compelling (good for YouTube).

9. Payments & Subscriptions (Stripe)

 Free plan (50 emails/month)
 Pro plan ($500/month, 5,000 emails/month)
 Business plan ($2,000/month, unlimited emails)
 Stripe checkout integration
 Payment confirmation webhook
 Update user plan after payment
 Enforce email limits per plan
 Cancel subscription
 Change plan
 Invoice history
 Billing page showing current plan

Why: Revenue. You can't grow without monetization. Different plans = different user types (startup, scale-up, enterprise).

10. User Settings & Account

 Update profile (name, company, phone)
 Update email
 Change password
 API key management (for integrations)
 Connected accounts (email, SendGrid status)
 Notification preferences (email alerts)
 Download account data (GDPR)
 Delete account
 Billing information

Why: Users need control over their account. API keys let advanced users integrate with other tools (Zapier, etc).

QUALITY & PERFORMANCE FEATURES
11. Error Handling & Validation

 CSV validation (correct format, headers)
 Email format validation
 Rate limiting (prevent abuse)
 API error responses (clear error messages)
 Graceful degradation (if SendGrid is down, queue and retry)
 User-friendly error messages
 Logging all errors for debugging
 Alerting (if error rate spikes, notify you)

Why: Bad data = bad campaigns = users leave. Clear errors = users understand what went wrong & fix it.

12. Security

 HTTPS only
 Rate limiting per IP (prevent DDoS)
 Rate limiting per user (prevent overuse)
 Input sanitization (prevent SQL injection)
 CORS configured correctly
 Environment variables (API keys not in code)
 RLS on Supabase (users only see their own data)
 API key rotation
 Webhook verification (verify SendGrid is really SendGrid)

Why: Hacking = death. Data breaches = lawsuit. Users trust you with their contact lists (customer data).

13. Performance Optimization

 Database indexes (fast queries)
 Email sending in background job (doesn't block UI)
 Caching (don't regenerate emails if not needed)
 Pagination (list campaigns 10 at a time, not 1000)
 Lazy loading (load data as user scrolls)
 Image optimization (if using images)
 Code splitting (small JS bundles)
 CDN for static files
 Database connection pooling

Why: Slow = users leave. Amazon found 100ms delay = 1% sales drop. Your tool needs to feel fast.

14. Monitoring & Analytics

 Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
 Performance monitoring (which endpoints are slow?)
 Usage analytics (how many emails per plan?)
 User retention (daily/weekly active users)
 Feature usage (which features do users use most?)
 Email deliverability (inbox vs spam rate)
 Uptime monitoring (is SendGrid, Supabase up?)

Why: You need to know if the tool is working. Analytics guide product roadmap (build what users want).

Q: "Can I use my own email?"
A: "No, we send via SendGrid (enterprise deliverability). Your domain can be in reply-to."

Q: "How long until I get replies?"
A: "First replies usually within 24 hours of sending. Depends on list quality."

Q: "Can I export my data?"
A: "Yes, all data exportable as CSV. No lock-in."

Q: "Do you have API?"
A: "Yes, Pro/Business plans include API for advanced integrations."

Q: "What if I'm not technical?"
A: "Fully no-code. If stuck, we have support."

Q: "Can I use this for spam?"
A: "No. We prohibit spam in terms of service. We verify you're not spamming."

Q: "How much will I actually make with this?"
A: "Depends on offer quality + list quality. Average: 1-2% reply rate = 50 emails → 1 reply."

Q: "Is there a contract?"
A: "No contract. Cancel anytime. Monthly billing."
Why: FAQ removes objections before they kill the sale. Common questions answered = more conversions.

PART 6: SUMMARY - WHY EACH FEATURE IS REQUIRED
FeatureWhy It's RequiredAuthenticationUsers need secure accounts. Prevents data leaks. Handles multiple users on same email.Campaign ManagementUsers manage multiple campaigns (different audiences). Need to organize + track separately.CSV UploadSales teams have 100-1000 contacts. Manual entry = death. CSV = bulk import.Email ValidationBad emails = bounces = reputation damage. Validation saves users from themselves.AI GenerationCore value prop. Without AI, it's just another email tool. AI = differentiation.5 VariationsA/B testing. Different emails work for different people. Variations optimize reply rate.SendGrid IntegrationYou can't send at scale without SendGrid. Gmail would block you (spam filter). SendGrid = enterprise deliverability.Open TrackingUsers need to know if emails are working. No metrics = no proof = no customers.Click TrackingOpens don't matter if people don't click. Clicks = interest. Clicks drive conversions.Reply TrackingCore metric. Replies = leads. Without reply tracking, users don't know what worked.Follow-up SequencesFirst email = 5% reply. Follow-up 1 = 25% reply. Follow-ups 3-5x reply rate. Huge.Real-time DashboardUsers need to see campaigns working. Real-time = proof. Motivates usage.AnalyticsMetrics are the product. Users want to see: open rate, click rate, reply rate.Stripe IntegrationRevenue. You can't grow without monetizing. Stripe = industry standard.Pricing TiersFilters users. Free gets awareness. Pro gets users serious enough to pay. Business gets enterprise.Website/LandingYou need to explain what the tool does. Landing page = sales funnel. Without it, no customers.Social Proof"Is this legit?" Answer: testimonials. Testimonials = trust. Trust = conversion.Case StudiesProof of results. "Sarah got 12 customers" > any marketing claim. Case studies convert.FAQRemoves objections. Every objection = customer lost. FAQ = removes objections before they kill deal.SecurityData breach = lawsuit. Users trust you with contact lists. Security = responsibility.Mobile Responsive50% of traffic is mobile. Not responsive = missing half your users.PerformanceSlow = bounces. 3-second load = standard. Optimize for speed.Error HandlingBad UX = users leave. Good error messages = users understand + fix problems.DocumentationUsers get stuck. Good docs = less support tickets. Less support = less cost.
